# Why we need SDK
> As we have multiple different analytic SDKs and our own in-house analytic server, each of these has a different need that is the reason we have Analytic as a SDK which can do all housekeeping work and end application can very quicky integrate multiple analytics plugins and track user data on different analytic server.

If we look closely all common components remain same the only change is the content and some plugin specific extra param(s).so can swap or pick required plugin and build it according to your needs and you will get the desired data tracking.

# Features
